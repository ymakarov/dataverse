	dataType	Data Type	We currently support X-ray diffraction datasets. If you would like to deposit any other dataset type please contact us first at help@sbgrid.org.		text	1		TRUE	TRUE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE		sbgrid
	collectionDate	Date Collected/Created	Please indicate the date this dataset was collected. This information can often be located in image headers, file timestamps, or your lab notebooks. If the exact date is unknown, please provide a best estimate.		date	2		TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE		sbgrid
	subjectComposition	Subject Composition	Please check all that apply. Include all types of molecules that are present in your sample. Ligands should indicate co-factors, inhibitors, or other biologically relevant small molecules.		text	3		TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE	TRUE		sbgrid
	reprocessingInstructions	Reprocessing Instructions	Please provide special instructions for data re-processing, including critical parameters that are inaccurate in image headers, the detector type, additional merging instructions, etc. Some examples of critical information: 1) Beam center, as defined in image headers, needs to be corrected to X=150,Y170; 2) This is a low resolution dataset and needs to be combined with high res datasets to obtain complete coverage; 3) This dataset was indexed in space group P21, and 120 frames were processed with HKL2000 at 3.2A resolution.		textbox	4		TRUE	FALSE	FALSE	FALSE	TRUE	FALSE		sbgrid
